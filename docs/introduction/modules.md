# Supabase Modules

Supabase Modules is an open-source initiative designed to enhance and speed the development of applications using **pre-built, modular components** that integrate seamlessly with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

> Our main goals is, regardless of the stage of development, to **significantly reduce the time and effort involved in creating robust, feature-rich applications** using Supabase.

Whether you are initiating a new project or refining an existing one, we want to enable the tools and support to make your Supabase development process streamlined and effective.

**Note** This project is not a replacement for [Supabase Bootstrap](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-bootstrap), which allows you to use different templates to get your project started.
